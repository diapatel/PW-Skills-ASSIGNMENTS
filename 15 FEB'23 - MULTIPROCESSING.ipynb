    "<b>QUESTION 1: </b>What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?<br>\n",
    "<b>SOLUTION: </b>Multiprocessing refers to the ability to execute multiple processes or tasks simultaneously on multiple processors or cores of a computer, as opposed to executing them in a sequential manner.\n",
    "* In simpler terms, multiprocessing allows you to take advantage of the multi-core processors in modern computers to perform CPU-intensive tasks more efficiently, by splitting them into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously on different processors. This can significantly reduce the time taken to complete the tasks and improve the overall performance of the program.\n",
    "* In Python, the multiprocessing module provides a way to create and manage multiple processes. It offers several classes and functions to create and control processes, to communicate and share data between them, and to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during their execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some use cases of Multiprocessing are:\n",
    "* CPU-intensive tasks: Multiprocessing can speed up the execution of tasks that require a lot of CPU time, such as image processing, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parallel programming: Multiprocessing can be used to implement parallel algorithms, where multiple processes work together to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalability: Multiprocessing can help to scale up the performance of a program as the size of the data or the complexity of the problem increases.\n"
